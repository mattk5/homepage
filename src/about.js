I completed an 18-week immersive program at Dev Bootcamp where I've learned and created programs using Ruby, Javascript & Ruby on Rails. <br/> Risking it all by leaving Retail Management in Hawaii to pursue Computer Programming in New York has been an enriching and rewarding experience. As a Web Developer, I enjoy working with the Back-End but also dabble with the Front-End as well. </p>
