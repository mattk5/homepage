					<p className="about-body">Aloha! After discovering my passion for programming I moved to New York, leaving my life in Hawaii to pursue a career in Web Development. I completed an 18-week immersive program at Dev Bootcamp where I fine tuned my programming mindset and created applications using Ruby, Javascript, & Ruby on Rails. Learning NodeJS, ExpressJS, & ReactJS has allowed me to level up and create some cool things since then. <br/><br/>
						I’ve always been passionate about helping others in any aspect of life. Coming from a retail management background in the health industry, I’ve had a successful career of exceeding sales goals and developing talent for growth in the company. My greatest joy is forming countless friendships with my clientele and working with them to achieve their health and wellness goals. </p>
